Every student is assigned one TA for each assignment, check for their announcements and book hours for grading. 

Try to use scripts to set up environment for assignments so they can be run in any environment

For shell scripts on the top as the first line we mention which interpreter has to be used for running the script

`#!/bin/bash`
`#!/bin/sh`

Use `trap` statements in shell scripts to handle graceful termination situations, when users try to kill the script execution in between.
