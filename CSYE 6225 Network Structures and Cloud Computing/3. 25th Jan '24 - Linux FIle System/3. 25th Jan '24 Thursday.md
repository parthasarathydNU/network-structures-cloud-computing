### Operating systems
Linux is not the entire operating system, but just the kernel. Linux based operating systems are based on different philosophies. 

#cloud-todo 
Different kernels branch from base kernels -- check about this hierarchy. Upstream / Downstream  

#cloud-todo
Check Debian vs Fedora

Kernel space and user space. When building applications, we target the user space.

### Components of Operating Systems

**Boot loader** : The program that starts your OS. BIOS -> Boot loader -> OS
**Kernel**
**Daemon** : background services
**Desktop environment** : Not installed in servers - takes up a lot of space. Some linux kernels have proprietary packages that come along with it. So while installing those kernels we need to check if those proprietary packages can get installed on the hardware. 

Package managers also have different philosophies - apt, dnf, yum, ...

### Linux Shell

When user logs in the login program checks the user credentials and then opens up the shell - which is the program that lets users interact with the kernel.

Popular Linux shells : 
- Bourne Shell (sh), 
- Korn Shell (ksh), 
- Z shell (zsh), 
- bourne-again shell (bash)
- C shell (csh / tcsh)

Different shells have different features like I/O device interaction.

Check out shell customization. Use `eco $SHELL` to find out what type of shell is being used.
