This assignment runs locally on your laptop, no need for VM.
The APIs in this assignment should not have a request body or a response body (payload).
**If someone sends a payload, figure out what error message to send** 

The check that we are going to perform is whether an application can talk to the DB or not.

**It is very important that there is no payload on return.**
**The response codes are very important**

Late submission has a penalty of 10% - save every single point you can.
