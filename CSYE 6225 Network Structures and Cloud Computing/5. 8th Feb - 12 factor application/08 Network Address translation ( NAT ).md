In residential settings, all the devices that are present on the same subnet is assigned the same public IP. 

With a NAT gateway, we can have 1 public IP, but have 100s of devices connected within the subnet. 

NAT allows ISPs to support more systems with the limited availability of IPs.

Today even toasters, ovens and light bulbs have IP addresses.
