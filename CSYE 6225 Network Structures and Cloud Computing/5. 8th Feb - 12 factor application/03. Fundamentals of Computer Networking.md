### What is Network ?

When we want to deploy services on the cloud. We need to set up a network. 

**ALERT:** Never ever use anything default provided by the cloud provider , unless instructed to do so. Because stuff in default services can't be changed. 

#### Types:
- LAN - all on the same network, not using internet to talk to other systems
- WAN - wide area network

### Communications link

When we use cloud, the different systems are connected directly connected with each other. But we don't have access over it. 

Systems are connected to each other via communication links such as coaxial or fiber cable or radio waves. So different network providers, based on the type of link they provide different upper limit of the bandwidth. 

Measured in **bits/second**. 1 **B**yte is 8 **b**its. 

For other systems we use Bytes but for network bandwidth we use **b**its.

### Bandwidth

how much data we can transfer in a given second. Maximum rate of data transfer across a given pair. 

Bandwidth determines network I/O that we can have. 


### Protocol

Format and order of messages exchanged between two or more systems.
