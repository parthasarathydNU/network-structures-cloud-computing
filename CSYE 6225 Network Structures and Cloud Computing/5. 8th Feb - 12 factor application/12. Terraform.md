### Install
Download a binary and put it on your path

### Writing Terraform Files
- Plain text files, written in the HashiCorp Config Language *.tf*

### Provider
- The first step is to configure the provider(s) you want to use
  ```shell
  provider "aws" {
	  region = "us-east-2"
  }
```

### Plan
The plan to execute, it checks the existing state and tells what will happen if this plan is executed. 
Always check the output of this plan before you go ahead and apply a plan. 
Be careful when it says something is going to be destroyed

### State
The last observed state of the current infrastructure. In case someone goes and makes changes manually, it is observed when someone else runs the plan command. 

### Destroy tf managed infra
- Adding delete protection to ensure the resource is not accidentally deleted

## .gitignore
`.terraform`
`*.tfstate*` and a couple of other files should never be pushed to the VCS system. 

### Resources and Modules

- Reusable modules 

### Demo

When we run the tf command, it combines all the separate tf file into one and considers that as a plan. It is a good practice to split them out and create them as separate files. 

In google, we have to enable APIs before we get to use it, check if you can enable it
